# Enhanced Audio Player Test

This is a test page for the enhanced audio player with the following features:

## Audio Player Features

The enhanced audio player includes:

- **Play/Pause/Stop controls** - Basic playback functionality
- **Progress tracking** - See current playback position and duration
- **Seek functionality** - Jump to any position in the audio
- **Web Audio API integration** - Advanced audio processing capabilities
- **Content filtering** - Only reads relevant text content

## Test Content

Here's some test content to read aloud:

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This pangram contains every letter of the alphabet at least once. It's commonly used for testing fonts, keyboards, and now our audio player!

Numbers work too: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

This content should be properly filtered to exclude any code blocks, images, or videos that shouldn't be read aloud.

```javascript
// This code block should NOT be read aloud
console.log('This is code and should be filtered out')
```

Back to regular content that should be read aloud.

## Testing Instructions

1. Click the Play button to start audio playback
2. Use the Pause button to pause playback
3. Use the Stop button to stop and reset playback
4. Test the seek functionality by clicking or dragging the progress bar
5. Verify that code blocks and other non-content elements are not read
6. Check that the progress indicator updates correctly during playback

The audio player should work smoothly without any console errors related to speech synthesis.
