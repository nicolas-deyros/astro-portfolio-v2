# Product Guidelines: Nicolás Deyros Portfolio

## 1. Visual Identity & Design Language

- **Clean & Minimalist:** The primary design philosophy is minimalism. Focus on generous whitespace, high-quality typography, and content clarity to reflect professionalism and a performance-first mindset.
- **High Contrast:** Visual elements must maintain high contrast ratios (aiming to exceed WCAG AA standards) to ensure readability for all users across various devices and lighting conditions.
- **Modern Accents:** Use subtle animations and modern UI patterns (consistent with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion usage in the project) to highlight innovation without compromising performance or usability.

## 2. Prose & Messaging

- **Concise & Direct:** Content should be brief and impactful. Respect the reader's time by delivering information efficiently.
- **Professional & Innovation-Focused:** Maintain a tone that is authoritative yet forward-thinking, emphasizing expertise in modern web standards and experimental technologies like on-device AI.
- **Technical Accuracy:** Ensure technical terms are used correctly and architectural choices are explained clearly for a developer-centric audience.

## 3. User Experience (UX) Principles

- **Performance First:** Every design and content decision should consider the impact on load times and interactivity. Maintain a Lighthouse score of 90+.
- **Accessibility as a Default:** Implement inclusive design practices from the start, including keyboard navigability, semantic HTML, and ARIA labels where necessary.
- **Seamless Interactivity:** Use Astro's Islands architecture to provide rich interactivity (via React) only where it adds value, ensuring the core experience remains fast and accessible.

## 4. Branding & Voice

- **The Technical Expert:** Position the portfolio as the work of a highly skilled engineer who stays at the forefront of web technology.
- **The Problem Solver:** Highlight projects and blog posts that demonstrate analytical thinking and effective solutions to complex problems.
- **Transparency:** Be open about the tools, libraries, and processes used (e.g., documenting the use of AI and comprehensive testing suites).
